# nano_projects
A small collection of small projects

Nothing special, just a place to house a few microscopic projects, mostly R scripts.  Check the wiki, as I will try to include some write ups on these various little projects.

Contents:
- Bauxite = an R script to make a 2x2 confusion matrix and calculate key Bayes-esque measures
- BlackJack = an R script that runs a simulated hand of blackjack and explores probabilities within the game
- Zill Rent Analysis = R script analyzing the Zillow Rent Price dataset from kaggle
- Custom R Plot Theme = a custom R plot theme inspired by cyberpunk 2077 art style
