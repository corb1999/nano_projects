# nano_projects
A small collection of small projects

Nothing special, just a place to house a few microscopic projects, mostly R scripts.  Check the wiki, as I will try to include some write ups on these various little projects.

## Contents:
- Analysis template = an R script template to keep EDA organized and style consistent
- Bauxite = an R script (and function version) to make a 2x2 confusion matrix and calculate key Bayes-esque measures
- BlackJack = an R script that runs a simulated hand of blackjack and explores probabilities within the game
- CHOAM = an R script and a csv file to generate synthetic data for CHOAM the fictional galactic cartel from Dune
- CHOAM Transactions = R script to simulate fictional transactions/trades between Dune's fictional houses
- Corb77 = a custom R plot theme inspired by cyberpunk 2077 art style
