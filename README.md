# nano_projects
A small collection of small projects

Nothing special, just a place to house a few microscopic projects, mostly R scripts.

Contents:
- Bauxite = an R script to make a 2x2 confusion matrix and calculate key Bayes-esque measures
- BlackJack = an R script that runs a simulated hand of blackjack and explores probabilities within the game
